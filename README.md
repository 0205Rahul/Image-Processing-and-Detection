# Image-Processing-and-Detection

Image processing refers to a set of techniques used to manipulate digital images to extract useful information or enhance their visual quality. It involves using mathematical algorithms to perform operations such as filtering, segmentation, and edge detection to extract information from images.

Image detection is a subfield of image processing that focuses on identifying objects or patterns within an image. It involves using algorithms to analyze image data and identify regions of interest or specific objects within an image.

Image processing and detection are used in a variety of applications, such as medical imaging, surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. They play a crucial role in enabling machines to "see" and make decisions based on visual input.
